plot_modem_mesh.py
========================
Companion plotting script for precompute.py.

Produces depth-slice maps and vertical cross-sections of log10(ρ) (or
linear ρ) from a ModEM 3-D MT inversion result. Reads
the UTM-km NetCDF files produced by precompute.py; no
GMT/PyGMT required.

Exact mesh rendering
---------------------
ModEM meshes are non-uniform (dx/dy/dz grow geometrically in the padding
cells outside the fine core region), so this script never resamples the
model onto a uniform pixel grid or interpolates/blends values across cell
boundaries. Every figure is a true, unblended cut through the mesh's own
cells, using the exact cell-edge geometry from modem_grid_edges_utm.nc
(written by precompute.py):
* Depth slices: pcolormesh(easting_edges, northing_edges, field,
  shading="flat") — each rendered patch is exactly one real mesh cell, at
  its true position and true size.
* Vertical sections: the profile line is intersected with the mesh's own
  grid lines to find the exact sequence of cells it actually crosses (see
  compute_vertical_slice_modem) — each rendered patch is one real 3-D
  cell's value, with true along-profile and true depth boundaries. No
  RegularGridInterpolator, no resampling.

Shares the same basemap engine (topo hillshade, ocean fill, feature overlays,
colourbar placement, clipping) as plot_seis.py.  The main differences
are:

* Data overlay: log10(ρ) depth slices from modem_rho_utm_{D}km.nc
  instead of seismic-velocity grids.
* Sensitivity-based shading/blanking: if precompute.py found a
  .sns sensitivity/resolution file, modem_sens_utm.nc /
  modem_sens_utm_{D}km.nc are used to blank (NaN) and/or shade
  poorly-resolved cells on both the horizontal slices and the vertical
  sections — see USE_SENSITIVITY, SENS_BLANK_THRESHOLD, SENS_SHADE_RANGE.
* MT sites: read from modem_sites_utm.nc (produced by the precompute script)
  instead of a plain CSV — avoids redundant coordinate conversion.
* No seismicity depth-window loop: a single seismicity catalogue depth filter
  per slice, controlled by ZMIN_SEISM / ZMAX_SEISM lists.
* Topo NetCDF: modem_topo_utm.nc (elevation in metres, positive up,
  dims northing/easting) produced by the ModEM precompute script.
* No bathymetry file is required from the precompute script; the seis-pipeline
  bath grid ({SITE_PREFIX}_bath_utm.nc) can be reused if available, otherwise the
  ocean fill is skipped gracefully.

# NOTE: kept ON *in addition to* SENS_ALPHA_RANGE below — belt-and-braces.
# SENS_ALPHA_RANGE already makes these cells fully transparent by itself,
# but blanking to NaN also removes them from the colour-scale/data array,
# which matters if this array is reused elsewhere (e.g. exported).
SENS_BLANK_THRESHOLD = -6  # log10(1e-4) — sensitivity < 1e-4

# Cells with sensitivity between these two values get a smooth semi-
# transparent white overlay fading from fully shaded (SENS_SHADE_MAX_ALPHA,
# at or below the first value) to unshaded (0 alpha, at or above the
# second) — a softer "how much to trust this" cue than a hard blank cutoff.
# Set to None to disable shading. Values are in the same units as
# SENS_TRANSFORM.
# Switched OFF for now: it was washing everything from -4 to 0 with an
# opaque-ish white layer, which is a *different* effect from "make the
# low-sensitivity area transparent" (it actually makes it more opaque, just
# white instead of coloured) and was likely what made sensitivity masking

# itself* (the resistivity colour, not an overlay on top of it) from fully
# transparent (at/below the first value) to its normal opacity
# (1 - ALPHA_RHO, at/above the second). Unlike SENS_SHADE_RANGE — which
# washes poorly-resolved cells with an extra flat colour on top — this
# lets whatever is drawn underneath (the topography hillshade basemap, in
# particular) show straight through in poorly-resolved areas, which reads
# better than grey/white wash when the point is to relate resistivity
# structure to topography. Can be used together with SENS_SHADE_RANGE/
# SENS_BLANK_THRESHOLD, or on its own. Set to None to disable (data alpha
# stays the constant 1 - ALPHA_RHO everywhere, as before). Values are in
# the same units as SENS_TRANSFORM (log10 sensitivity by default).
#
# NOTE on the upper bound: with SENS_TRANSFORM="LOG10", sensitivity itself
# is normalised to [0, 1], so log10(sensitivity) never exceeds 0 — the
# best-resolved cell you can ever have sits at exactly 0. That means the
# *second* value of this range (where opacity reaches its normal maximum)
# should essentially always stay 0; only the first value (how lenient the
# cutoff is) is worth changing.

# Example (a) — sharp cutoff, no fade: everything below the threshold is
# fully transparent, everything at/above it is fully opaque, nothing in
# between. This is what's currently active below.

# VERTICAL SLICE SETTINGS
#
# VSLICES defines a list of arbitrary vertical cross-sections.
# Each entry is a dict with:
#
#   name    : str   — label used in title and output filename
#   p1      : [x, y] — first  endpoint, in UTM km OR lon/lat (see coord)
#   p2      : [x, y] — second endpoint, same convention
#   coord   : "utm"     — p1/p2 are [easting_km, northing_km]
#             "latlon"  — p1/p2 are [lon_deg, lat_deg]
#   zmin_km : float — top  of section (km, positive down; 0 = surface)
#   zmax_km : float — base of section (km, positive down)
#   swath_km: float — half-width (km) for projecting seismicity onto section
#   xlim    : optional [xmin, xmax] — crop the *displayed* x-axis range
#             without recomputing anything. Units must match VSLICE_X_AXIS
#             below: UTM easting/northing (km) for "utm", or cumulative
#             distance from p1 (km) for "distance". This only narrows the
#             plotted view, so it's cheap to iterate on for fine-tuning a
#             figure. Omit or set to None for the full profile (default).
#
# There is no npts/nz sample-resolution setting: sections are cut using
# the mesh's own exact cell geometry (see compute_vertical_slice_modem),
# so the resolution along the profile and in depth is whatever the real

    Cut the ModEM resistivity model (modem_model_utm.nc) along a vertical
    profile using the mesh's own, exact cell geometry — no interpolation.

    The profile line is intersected with the mesh's real grid lines
    (modem_grid_edges_utm.nc) to find the exact sequence of (i,j) cell
    columns it passes through; within each such along-profile segment,
    every depth cell is drawn with its own real value and its own real
    depth-edge boundaries (also exact — z edges are the same everywhere
    in x,y for a ModEM tensor mesh, so no approximation is needed there
