plot_modem_image.py
=========================
Companion plotting script for precompute.py.

Produces depth-slice maps of log10(ρ) (or linear ρ) from a ModEM 3-D MT
inversion result.  Reads the UTM-km NetCDF files
produced by precompute.py; no GMT/PyGMT required.

Shares the same basemap engine (topo hillshade, ocean fill, feature overlays,
colourbar placement, clipping) as plot_seis.py.  The main differences
are:

* Data overlay: log10(ρ) depth slices from modem_rho_utm_{D}km.nc
  instead of seismic-velocity grids.
* Sensitivity-based shading/blanking: if precompute.py found a
  .sns sensitivity/resolution file, modem_sens_utm.nc /
  modem_sens_utm_{D}km.nc are used to blank (NaN) and/or shade
  poorly-resolved cells on both the horizontal slices and the vertical
  sections — see USE_SENSITIVITY, SENS_BLANK_THRESHOLD, SENS_SHADE_RANGE.
* MT sites: read from modem_sites_utm.nc (produced by the precompute script)
  instead of a plain CSV — avoids redundant coordinate conversion.
* No seismicity depth-window loop: a single seismicity catalogue depth filter
  per slice, controlled by ZMIN_SEISM / ZMAX_SEISM lists.
* Topo NetCDF: modem_topo_utm.nc (elevation in metres, positive up,
  dims northing/easting) produced by the ModEM precompute script.
* No bathymetry file is required from the precompute script; the seis-pipeline
  bath grid ({SITE_PREFIX}_bath_utm.nc) can be reused if available, otherwise the
  ocean fill is skipped gracefully.

# opaque-ish white layer, which is a *different* effect from "make the
# low-sensitivity area transparent" (it actually makes it more opaque, just

# washes poorly-resolved cells with an extra flat colour on top — this
# lets whatever is drawn underneath (the topography hillshade basemap, in
# particular) show straight through in poorly-resolved areas, which reads
# better than grey/white wash when the point is to relate resistivity
# structure to topography. Can be used together with SENS_SHADE_RANGE/
# SENS_BLANK_THRESHOLD, or on its own. Set to None to disable (data alpha
# stays the constant 1 - ALPHA_RHO everywhere, as before). Values are in

#
# NOTE on the upper bound: with SENS_TRANSFORM="LOG10", sensitivity itself
# is normalised to [0, 1], so log10(sensitivity) never exceeds 0 — the
# best-resolved cell you can ever have sits at exactly 0. That means the
# *second* value of this range (where opacity reaches its normal maximum)
# should essentially always stay 0; only the first value (how lenient the
# cutoff is) is worth changing.

# VERTICAL SLICE SETTINGS
#
# VSLICES defines a list of arbitrary vertical cross-sections.
# Each entry is a dict with:
#
#   name    : str   — label used in title and output filename
#   p1      : [x, y] — first  endpoint, in UTM km OR lon/lat (see coord)
#   p2      : [x, y] — second endpoint, same convention
#   coord   : "utm"     — p1/p2 are [easting_km, northing_km]
#             "latlon"  — p1/p2 are [lon_deg, lat_deg]
#   zmin_km : float — top  of section (km, positive down; 0 = surface)
#   zmax_km : float — base of section (km, positive down)
#   npts    : int   — sample points along the profile
#   nz      : int   — depth levels (interpolated between model cells)
#   swath_km: float — half-width (km) for projecting seismicity onto section
#   xlim    : optional [xmin, xmax] — crop the *displayed* x-axis range
#             without recomputing anything. Units must match VSLICE_X_AXIS
#             below: UTM easting/northing (km) for "utm", or cumulative
#             distance from p1 (km) for "distance". The full profile is
#             still sampled/interpolated (npts/nz unaffected) — this only
#             narrows the plotted view, so it's cheap to iterate on for
#             fine-tuning a figure. Omit or set to None for the full
#             profile (default).

#             range without recomputing anything. Depth in km, positive
#             down, given top-first (ytop is the shallower/smaller value,
