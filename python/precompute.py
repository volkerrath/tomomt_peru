precompute.py
====================
Combined pre-computation script for the imaging pipeline.

Site-specific settings (input files, region box, depth lists, etc.) are
kept as capitalized constants below; where they differ between sites, the
currently-active value is live and any other site's value is kept as a
labeled, commented-out alternative (e.g. "# TACNA") right next to it, so
switching sites is a matter of swapping which line is commented.

This merges what were previously two separate scripts:
  * precompute_modem.py  (Part A below) — ModEM 3-D MT resistivity
    inversion results (+ optional sensitivity/resolution field).
  * precompute_seis.py   (Part B below) — seismic tomography
    Vp / Vs / Vp-Vs-ratio, topography/bathymetry, and (new) density.

Both parts read their own model files, reproject/crop/slice them onto UTM
(Zone 19S, EPSG:32719) grids in km, and write NetCDF files consumed by the
companion plot scripts (plot_modem_image.py, plot_modem_mesh.py,
plot_seis.py). They are combined into one script because they share
region-of-interest settings (TAR_LON/TAR_LAT/CROP_TO_REGION — see SHARED
SETTINGS below) and because a density model, added here, sits alongside the
seismic Vp/Vs tomography and is processed exactly the same way.

What this script produces
--------------------------
Part A (ModEM / MT, native ModEM mesh):
  modem_model_utm.nc         — full 3-D log10(ρ) resistivity model
  modem_sens_utm.nc          — full 3-D sensitivity/resolution field (optional)
  modem_topo_utm.nc          — 2-D surface topography extracted from the model
  modem_sites_utm.nc         — MT site positions
  modem_rho_utm_{D}km.nc     — horizontal log10(ρ) slice at depth D km
  modem_sens_utm_{D}km.nc    — matching sensitivity slice (optional)
  modem_grid_edges_utm.nc    — exact (non-uniform) mesh cell edges
  modem_submesh_points.nc    — full submesh flattened to one row per cell
                                (easting/northing/depth + resistivity +
                                sensitivity), for clustering

Part B (seismic tomography + density, seismic grid):
  {SITE_PREFIX}_topo_utm.nc          — topography on UTM-km grid
  {SITE_PREFIX}_bath_utm.nc          — bathymetry mask (topo ≤ 0) on UTM-km grid
  {SITE_PREFIX}_vp.nc / {SITE_PREFIX}_vs.nc / {SITE_PREFIX}_vps.nc / {SITE_PREFIX}_dens.nc
                              — full Vp / Vs / Vp-Vs-ratio / density subsets
                                (depth coord + UTM aux coords)
  {SITE_PREFIX}_vp_utm_{tag}.nc  }
  {SITE_PREFIX}_vs_utm_{tag}.nc  }
  {SITE_PREFIX}_vps_utm_{tag}.nc }    — per-depth UTM-km slices
  {SITE_PREFIX}_dens_utm_{tag}.nc}    — per-depth UTM-km density slice

Density (Part B) — renamed "dens", not "rho"
------------------------------------------------
FNAME_DENS (default "../seistomo/FD_rho_model.nc" — the source *file* is
still named FD_rho_model.nc on disk) is read, cropped, and sliced with
exactly the same logic already used for Vp/Vs — same region box, same
DEPTH_INDEX depths, same UTM reprojection helper (slice_to_utm_km_nc). It
is expected to sit on the same (lat, lon, depth) grid as FD_vp_model.nc; a
non-fatal warning is printed at run time if that grid doesn't match, since
a silent mismatch there would misalign density slices against velocity
ones. Exported as "dens" ({SITE_PREFIX}_dens.nc, {SITE_PREFIX}_dens_utm_{tag}.nc)
rather than "rho", since "rho" is already used throughout Part A for MT
resistivity (modem_rho_utm_*.nc) — same-sounding names on two physically
different quantities, on two different grids, was a bug waiting to happen.

Note — no more MT-onto-seismic-grid resampling here
------------------------------------------------------------------
Earlier versions of this script resampled resistivity onto the seismic
Vp/Vs/density grid here in precompute (modem_rho_on_seisgrid*.nc). That
step has moved to cluster.py, which now RBF-interpolates every
clustering variable — resistivity/conductivity from modem_submesh_points.nc
below, Vp/Vs/density from Part B's own outputs — onto one jointly-defined
regular grid, rather than onto the seismic tomography grid specifically.
See cluster.py / README_cluster.md.

Full submesh point table, for clustering (Part A, new)
------------------------------------------------------------------
See save_submesh_table() below. modem_submesh_points.nc flattens the full
3-D resistivity (and sensitivity) field on its own native ModEM submesh —
at full native resolution — into one row per cell: easting_km/northing_km/
depth_km as ordinary columns alongside resistivity/sensitivity. This is
now cluster.py's actual source for resistivity: it loads this point
table directly and RBF-interpolates it onto the joint clustering grid
(rather than this script resampling it onto the seismic grid first, as it
used to). Air-masked/out-of-mesh cells stay NaN (with a `valid` flag)
rather than being dropped, so the clustering code can apply whatever NaN
policy it prefers. Toggle with EXPORT_SUBMESH_TABLE (Part A settings).

Coordinate convention (Part A / ModEM)
----------------------------------------
ModEM uses a local Cartesian mesh whose origin is the *reference point*
(lat_ref, lon_ref) stored in the last non-comment line of the .rho file.
The mesh x-axis points North, y-axis East, z-axis Down (positive downward).
Cell sizes dx, dy, dz are in metres. See build_utm_axes/build_utm_edges
below for how these are turned into absolute UTM easting/northing (km).

Region of interest
-------------------
TRIM_PAD (Part A only) drops a fixed number of padding cells from each
face, but ModEM padding cells grow geometrically toward the model
boundary, so a small TRIM_PAD count can still leave a domain far larger
than the area actually of interest. CROP_TO_REGION (shared, see below)
further crops both parts to the same geographic box TAR_LON/TAR_LAT, so
the ModEM and seismic outputs cover matching areas.

Helpers used from modem.py (Part A)
--------------------------------------
  read_mod(file, modext, trans)   — reads .rho file → dx, dy, dz, mval, reference
  read_data(Datfile, modext)      — reads .dat file → Site, Comp, Data, Head
  cells3d(dx, dy, dz, center)     — cumulative cell-centre coordinates
  get_topo(dx, dy, dz, mval, ref) — extracts 2-D surface topography

Topography back-end (Part B)
--------------------------------
Requires the `elevation` package (pip install elevation) and its cli tool
`eio`, which downloads SRTM 30 m (land) / ETOPO1 (ocean) tiles on first use
and caches them locally. Alternatively, set TOPO_SOURCE = "etopo" to use
the ETOPO1 global relief NetCDF directly, or "geotiff" for a local file
(see SEISMIC SETTINGS below).

Dependencies
------------
    numpy, xarray, pandas, pyproj, scipy, rioxarray, elevation (eio), modem
    (project-local) — OR, without the "elevation" backend: numpy, xarray,
    pyproj, scipy, rioxarray (with a local GeoTIFF), modem (project-local)

# every downstream consumer sees a single consistent NaN rather than
# re-deriving its own cutoff. Any cell with |value| <= this threshold is
# masked to NaN — abs() because some codes use a negative sentinel too,
# and because for the LOG10/LOGE transforms a genuine physical value
# this close to zero would itself already blow up into a huge negative
# log the moment the transform is applied, so there's no real resistivity
# regime this could be mistaken for. Deliberately far below any real Ω·m
