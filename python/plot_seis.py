plot_seis.py
=================
Matplotlib replacement for the GMT-based seismic tomography plotting.

Produces comparable depth-slice maps of Vp, Vs, and Vp/Vs ratio for the
seismic-tomography study area using only standard Python scientific
packages (NumPy, Matplotlib, xarray, pandas, pyproj, scipy).

Reads the same pre-computed UTM-km NetCDF grids and CSV feature files
produced by precompute.py; no GMT/PyGMT installation required.

Differences from the GMT version
---------------------------------
* Topographic shading is reproduced via matplotlib LightSource hillshade.
* The bathymetry ocean-fill is a masked imshow with a single blue-grey colour.
* North arrow is drawn with matplotlib's annotate mechanism.
* Markers, label offsets, fonts, and line styles are all user parameters
  (see MARKER STYLE SETTINGS section below).
* Features outside the map region are clipped via ax.set_clip_on + the
  Axes bounding box, so no markers or labels bleed outside the plot area.

Dependencies
------------
    numpy, matplotlib, xarray, pandas, pyproj, scipy
