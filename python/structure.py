structure.py — Structural-coupling diagnostics between pairs (and triples)
of interpolated fields on the joint grid produced by ``interpolate.py``.

Renamed from ``cross_gradient.py`` (same pipeline position, same input
file, broadened scope: several structural-coupling measures from the
joint-inversion literature, not just the cross-gradient).

    precompute.py -> interpolate.py -> {SITE_PREFIX}_interp_<method>.nc
                                                     |
                                        structure.py -> figures

Reads the same ``INTERP_FILE`` NetCDF as ``plot_joint.py`` / ``cluster.py``
and is equally agnostic to which interpolation method produced it. For each
configured group of fields it computes one or more structural-coupling
diagnostics and plots them as depth-slice maps and (where wired in, see
"Known limitations" below) vertical cross-sections -- same styling
conventions (basemap, colorbar, marker/label style, VSLICES schema,
isoline toggles) as the rest of the plotting pipeline; see
``README_plot_joint.md`` for the shared conventions this script reuses.

Methods implemented (all computed from the same real-coordinate 3-D
gradients via ``gradient_components()``, so all are plottable on the same
mesh)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Let g1 = grad(m1), g2 = grad(m2) be the local gradient vectors of two
fields on the joint grid, and theta the angle between them.

  * Cross-gradient (Gallardo & Meju 2003, 2004)
        t = g1 x g2                              -- STRUCTURE_PAIRS, N=2
        |t| = |g1||g2| sin(theta)
    Zero wherever the two fields' local structure is parallel/anti-
    parallel, regardless of magnitude, sign, or units.

  * Cosine similarity / "directed" dot-product constraint
    (Molodtsov, Troyan, Roslov & Zerilli 2013)   -- STRUCTURE_PAIRS, N=2
        cos(theta) = (g1 . g2) / (|g1||g2|)  in [-1, 1]
    Signed: requires no cross-product, but the sign carries a priori
    information about which correlation direction ("directed") is
    expected between the two properties.

  * Squared cosine similarity (Shi, Yu, Zhao, Zhang & Yang 2018)
                                                  -- STRUCTURE_PAIRS, N=2
        cos^2(theta)  in [0, 1]
    Sign-free improvement on Molodtsov et al.'s constraint (no a priori
    correlation direction needed, at the cost of a possible sign
    ambiguity/singularity the original paper discusses).
    Identically, since sin^2 + cos^2 = 1 for the same angle:
        cos^2(theta) == 1 - [normalised cross-gradient]^2
    (a built-in numerical cross-check between the two families of
    measures above, both computed from the same g1/g2 here).

  * Gramian structural-coupling determinant (Zhdanov, Gribenko & Wilson
    2012)                                        -- GRAMIAN_GROUPS, N=2 or 3
        det(Gram(g_1, ..., g_N)),  Gram_ij = g_i . g_j
    At N=2 this is algebraically identical to |t|^2 above (Lagrange's
    identity: det(Gram(g1,g2)) = |g1|^2|g2|^2 - (g1.g2)^2 = |g1 x g2|^2),
    verified in earlier work on this project to ~1e-15 -- included here
    mainly for the N=3 case, which is genuinely novel (a squared scalar
    triple product measuring whether THREE fields' gradients are
    coplanar, not just whether two are parallel). N>3 needs a general
    NxN cofactor expansion that was not built here -- raises ValueError
    rather than guessing at one.

  * Windowed mutual information (optional, off by default; inspired by
    Mandolesi & Jones 2014, who used a *global*, whole-model mutual
    information as a joint-inversion objective, not a spatial diagnostic
    map) -- STRUCTURE_PAIRS, N=2, ENABLE_MUTUAL_INFO
    Unlike everything above, this compares the two fields' *values*
    (log10-transformed per LOG_FIELDS, same convention as the gradients)
    in a local sliding window via histogram-based density estimation,
    not their gradients -- it can register structural correlation even
    where both fields are locally smooth. The window size and bin count
    are free parameters with no literature- or pipeline-verified default
    for this project's grids; MI_WINDOW/MI_BINS are flagged as such
    rather than tuned/guessed at, and the feature defaults OFF. See
    ``windowed_mutual_information_2d()``. Only implemented for
    depth-slice maps (not sections, see below), and only for pairs
    (bivariate MI; no attempt made at a 3-way generalisation here).

Further coupling measures considered but not implemented here
---------------------------------------------------------------
Flagged rather than added speculatively -- these fit a different
computational pattern (inversion regularisers or statistical-distance
measures needing choices this script's config would have to invent) and
were left out of scope for this diagnostic-plotting stage:

  * Joint total variation (JTV) (Haber & Holtzman Gazit 2013, Surv.
    Geophys., 34, 675-695, doi:10.1007/s10712-013-9232-4) -- an
    inversion *regulariser* (couples the models by penalising the sum
    sqrt(|grad m1|^2 + |grad m2|^2)), not naturally a per-point
    diagnostic map the way the measures above are.
  * Variation of information (VI) -- introduced for this application in
    Moorkamp (2021), "Joint inversion of gravity and magnetotelluric
    data from the Ernest Henry IOCG deposit with a variation of
    information constraint", First Int'l Meeting for Applied Geoscience
    & Energy, SEG, pp. 1711-1715 (a conference proceedings paper; no DOI
    could be confirmed for it, flagged rather than fabricated), with the
    full derivation (including dVI/dm) given in Moorkamp (2022),
    "Deciphering the state of the lower crust and upper mantle with
    multi-physics inversion", Geophys. Res. Lett., 49(9), e2021GL096336,
    doi:10.1029/2021GL096336) and joint entropy-based coupling -- both are,
    like MI, global/statistical measures over the whole model rather
    than gradient-based local ones, and would need the same kind of
    windowing choice flagged for MI above.

Scope / known limitations
-------------------------
Only ``TARGET_GRID == "joint"`` (a genuinely regular UTM-km grid, see
``interpolate.py``) is supported. The reused seismic-tomography native
grid (``TARGET_GRID == "seismic"``) is only structured in (row, col) index
space, not orthogonal in UTM space, so a coordinate-exact 3-D gradient
(the same standard this pipeline holds gradients to elsewhere -- see
``gradient_magnitude()`` in ``plot_dens.py`` et al.) cannot be computed
from index-space finite differences without assuming near-orthogonality.
Rather than silently approximating, this script raises a clear error in
that case. Build ``INTERP_FILE`` with ``TARGET_GRID="joint"`` instead.

Three integration seams, flagged rather than guessed at:
  1. Basemap/marker/label styling -- see plot_map()/plot_section()
     docstrings.
  2. Vertical-section profile projection -- ``_profile_line()`` is a
     stub; see its docstring.
  3. Windowed mutual information is map-only (see above); wiring a
     along-profile version through ``_profile_line()`` once (2) is
     resolved would be a small follow-up, not attempted here.

    Local (sliding-window) mutual information between two co-located 2-D

    Unlike the gradient-based measures above, this compares field
    *values* directly rather than their spatial derivatives -- it can
    register a structural relationship even where both fields vary
    smoothly rather than sharply. Mandolesi & Jones (2014) used a
    *global*, whole-model mutual information as a joint-inversion
    objective; the local/windowed version here is a diagnostic-mapping
    choice made for this pipeline, not something taken from that paper.

    window, bins : if None, fall back to the module-level MI_WINDOW /
        MI_BINS. Both are free parameters with no literature- or
        pipeline-verified default for this project's grids -- flagged
        here rather than silently tuned; check they suit your grid
        spacing/target feature scale and sample count before trusting
        the output.

    Performance: O(rows * cols * window^2) numpy.histogram2d calls --
    can be slow on large grids. That is why ENABLE_MUTUAL_INFO defaults
    to False.
