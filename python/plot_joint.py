plot_joint.py
=====================
Depth-slice maps (and, where the grid is regular, vertical cross-
sections) of every field on the common grid produced by
interpolate.py — MT resistivity/conductivity/sensitivity and/or
seismic tomography Vp/Vs/Vp-Vs-ratio/density, whichever were
interpolated — INCLUDING their spatial gradients, if
interpolate.py's COMPUTE_GRADIENT was on.

This is the plotting counterpart to cluster.py: both scripts read
interpolate.py's output (INTERP_FILE) and are completely agnostic
to how that grid was built (a fresh joint UTM grid, or a reused
seismic-tomography native grid) or which interpolation method produced
it (RBF/kriging/IDW/nearest). Where cluster.py clusters the fields
and plots the resulting class labels, this script plots each field's own
value (and gradient magnitude/components) directly — no clustering.

Pipeline
--------
precompute.py → interpolate.py → {SITE_PREFIX}_interp_<method>.nc
                                                     ↓
                                    plot_joint.py → figures

Two grid modes (see interpolate.py's TARGET_GRID)
---------------------------------------------------------
  "joint"    — a genuinely regular UTM-km (depth, northing, easting)
    grid. Depth-slice maps are drawn with imshow(extent=...); vertical
    cross-sections (VSLICES, same schema as plot_seis.py) are
    supported, sampled via a 3-D RegularGridInterpolator directly in UTM
    space (simpler than plot_seis.py's own lat/lon-based sampler,
    since this grid is already in UTM).
  "seismic"  — a reused seismic-tomography native (depth, row, col) grid,
    NOT regular in UTM space (2-D utm_easting_km/utm_northing_km aux
    coords instead). Depth-slice maps are drawn with
    pcolormesh(shading="nearest") against those 2-D coords, matching
    cluster.py's own rendering. Vertical cross-sections are NOT
    supported in this mode (an arbitrary-angle straight-line cut through
    an irregular-in-UTM grid needs its own interpolation step — build
    INTERP_FILE with TARGET_GRID="joint" instead if you need sections);
    VSLICES is simply skipped with a printed warning.

Gradients (PLOT_GRADIENT)
----------------------------
If interpolate.py's COMPUTE_GRADIENT was True, INTERP_FILE also
carries, for each gradient variable, up to four extra data variables:
"{key}_grad_easting", "{key}_grad_northing", "{key}_grad_depth" (partial
derivatives) and "{key}_grad_mag" (their combined 3-D magnitude) — see
that script's own docstring. PLOT_GRADIENT here controls whether this
script ALSO produces gradient maps/sections for those fields.
GRADIENT_COMPONENTS picks which of "mag"/"easting"/"northing"/"depth" to
plot — "mag" only by default, since that is the one every other field
shares comparable units for at a glance. A field with no matching
"{key}_grad_*" in INTERP_FILE (either COMPUTE_GRADIENT was off, or that
key wasn't in interpolate.py's GRADIENT_VARS) is silently skipped.

Standard layout: property + |∇field| paired (PAIR_GRADIENT_WITH_FIELD)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Whenever a field's gradient MAGNITUDE was plotted (PLOT_GRADIENT=True,
"mag" in GRADIENT_COMPONENTS, and that field has one), it's drawn in the
SAME figure as the field itself, each keeping its own colour scale/
colorbar (VAR_STYLE / GRAD_STYLE respectively) — rather than as two
separate files. This is the default (PAIR_GRADIENT_WITH_FIELD=True); set
it False to go back to one file per panel. The two panels are arranged
side by side (1 row × 2 columns) or stacked (2 rows × 1 column)
automatically, based on the aspect ratio a SINGLE panel would have on
its own — a wide/landscape panel (e.g. a broad map, or a long vertical
section) stacks vertically so the combined figure doesn't end up
implausibly wide; a tall/portrait panel goes side by side so it doesn't
end up implausibly tall (see _build_dual_panel_figure). Falls back to a
single-panel figure automatically wherever there's nothing to pair with
(no gradient computed, "mag" not requested, or that field wasn't in
GRADIENT_VARS) — PLOT_GRADIENT/GRADIENT_COMPONENTS still control what's
available to pair in the first place. Any OTHER gradient components you
also request (e.g. "easting") are NOT paired — magnitude is the natural
partner; other components remain their own separate single-panel
figures, with a "_grad<component>" filename suffix as before.

Colour scales (VAR_STYLE)
-----------------------------
Unlike plot_seis.py / plot_dens.py — each hard-coded to one
or three known fields — the set of fields actually present in
INTERP_FILE is only known at run time (whatever interpolate.py's
INTERP_VARS happened to be). VAR_STYLE below is therefore a dict keyed
by field name, giving each a colormap and a (cmin, cmax) pair; a field
not listed there falls back to DEFAULT_CMAP and auto-scaling (cmin/cmax
= None -> the finite min/max of that particular depth slice/section,
computed fresh per panel, same convention as the other plot scripts'
CMIN_GRAD=None/CMAX_GRAD=None default). Gradient magnitude/component
panels always auto-scale (there is no natural fixed range for a spatial
derivative) unless given an explicit override in GRAD_STYLE.

Most settings below (basemap, colorbar layout, marker/label styles,
CSV feature paths, VSLICES schema, isolines) are carried over unchanged
from plot_seis.py / cluster.py — see those scripts' own
comments for the full rationale behind each one; only the parts specific
to plotting an arbitrary set of interpolated fields are re-explained
here.

Dependencies
------------
    numpy, xarray, pandas, matplotlib, scipy (RegularGridInterpolator,
    only used for "joint"-mode vertical sections)
plus the local `tomomt.py` helper module.

    Sibling of tomomt.build_panel_figure(): lays out TWO identically-sized
    panels (each panel_w_in × panel_h_in), each with its own colorbar per
    `colorbar` settings, in one figure — used to put a field and its
    gradient magnitude next to each other (see PAIR_GRADIENT_WITH_FIELD
    in the settings above). Not in tomomt.py itself since it's only
    needed here; mirrors build_panel_figure's inch-exact placement math,
    just duplicated per panel and offset by one panel-plus-colorbar
    "block" size plus gap_in.

    Orientation is chosen automatically from the SINGLE panel's own
    aspect ratio, not fixed: panel_w_in >= panel_h_in (a wide/landscape
    single panel, e.g. a broad map or a long vertical section) stacks
    the two blocks vertically (2 rows × 1 column) so the combined figure
    doesn't end up implausibly wide; a tall/portrait single panel
    (panel_h_in > panel_w_in) places them side by side (1 row × 2
    columns) so the combined figure doesn't end up implausibly tall.
    Either way the two panels keep exactly their usual single-panel size
    — only how they're arranged changes.

    Returns (fig, ax_1, cax_1, ax_2, cax_2) — reading order is left-then-
    right for the side-by-side case, top-then-bottom for the stacked
