"""femtic_viz_new.py

Visualisation utilities for FEMTIC resistivity models.

This module focuses on two complementary workflows:

1. **Direct-from-FEMTIC files (no intermediate NPZ)**:
   - ``mesh.dat`` + ``resistivity_block_iterX.dat`` -> NumPy arrays / PyVista grid
   - Matplotlib map slices (XY at depth) and curtain slices (profile vs depth)
   - PyVista sampling on explicit slice surfaces

2. **Convenience wrappers for NPZ-based workflows** (optional):
   - Uses functions from ``femtic.py`` if you already work with NPZ models.

The direct workflow is usually preferred for quick inspection because it avoids
writing any temporary model files.

Provenance:
    2025-12-23  vrath   Created (with ChatGPT GPT-5 Thinking).
    2026-03-24  Claude  Added plot_data_ensemble and plot_model_ensemble
                        for RTO ensemble diagnostic plots.
    2026-03-29  Claude  Added n_sites parameter to plot_data_ensemble for
                        random site sub-sampling per row.
                        Fixed ocean_value default: 1e-10 -> 3e-1 Ohm.m in
                        prepare_rho_for_plotting and
                        unstructured_grid_from_femtic.
                        Added ocean_color parameter (default 'lightgrey') to
                        plot_points_matplotlib, plot_map_grid_matplotlib,
                        plot_curtain_matplotlib, map_slice_from_cells,
                        curtain_from_cells, and plot_model_ensemble.
    2026-03-30  Claude  Fixed plot_data_ensemble: replaced non-existent
                        fem.read_observe() with fem.read_observe_dat();
                        added _observe_to_site_list() helper to flatten the
                        nested blocks->sites structure and build Z/Z_err/T/P
                        complex arrays for data_viz.datadict_to_plot_df;
                        plotter now iterates per-site rather than passing the
                        whole file dict; n_sites sub-sampling now operates on
                        site index list rather than dict keys.
    2026-03-30  Claude  Fixed rho_a unit mismatch in _observe_to_site_list:
                        FEMTIC observe.dat Z is in SI Ohm; data_viz assumes
                        mV/km/nT (field units). Rewrote helper to use
                        fem.observe_to_site_viz_list() as authoritative reader,
                        then scales Z by 1/(mu0*1e3) to field units before
                        passing to datadict_to_plot_df. Also simplified
                        plot_data_ensemble: removed redundant read_observe_dat
                        pre-call; _observe_to_site_list now takes file path
                        directly.
    2026-03-30  Claude  Split show_errors into show_errors_orig and
                        show_errors_pert in plot_data_ensemble (default both
                        False); raw template errors are misleading at long
                        periods, perturbed files carry reset relative errors.
    2026-04-02  Claude  Added xlim/ylim/zlim parameters to plot_model_ensemble.
                        Map slices: xlim/ylim clip easting/northing axes.
                        Curtain slices: ylim clips profile-distance axis,
                        zlim clips the depth axis. Per-slice dict keys
                        override the function-level defaults.
    2026-04-03  Claude  Added alpha_orig/alpha_pert to plot_data_ensemble
                        (opacity per curve type; defaults 1.0/0.6).
                        Added mesh_lines/mesh_lw/mesh_color to
                        plot_model_ensemble, map_slice_from_cells,
                        curtain_from_cells, and plot_points_matplotlib;
                        triplot overlay drawn after tripcolor when enabled.
    2026-04-12  Claude  Added comp_markers to plot_data_ensemble: different
                        marker symbols for diagonal (ii), off-diagonal (ij),
                        and invariant components.  Default dict maps 'ii'->'o',
                        'ij'->'s', 'inv'->'^'; pass None to disable markers.
                        Added error_style_orig / error_style_pert parameters
                        ('shade' / 'bar' / 'both') for independent control of
                        error rendering on original vs. perturbed curves; no
                        shared fallback variable.
                        Markers applied post-hoc (snapshot ax.lines before
                        plotter call, patch new Line2D objects after).
                        Fixed legend: each component gets legend=True on its
                        first occurrence; final ax.legend() deduplicates.
                        plot_data_ensemble redesigned for multi-panel layouts:
                        'what' now accepts a list of panel types (e.g.
                        ['rho', 'phase', 'tipper']); 'comps' may be a single
                        string (shared) or a per-panel list; returned axs
                        shape is (n_samples, n_panels).
    2026-04-12  Claude  Added perlims / rholims / phslims / vtflims / ptlims
                        parameters to plot_data_ensemble for optional axis-
                        limit control.  perlims sets ax.set_xlim on every
                        panel; the remaining four set ax.set_ylim on their
                        respective panel type only.  Applied post-hoc after
                        each cell is filled so underlying plotters cannot
                        override them.
    2026-05-13  Claude  Added plot_model_3d: PyVista 3-D renderer with
                        axis-aligned x/y/z plane slices, arbitrary oblique
                        plane slices, and iso-surfaces of any cell-data
                        scalar.  Outputs interactive HTML or static screenshot.
    2026-05-26  Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Anthropic)
                        plot_model_3d: added vtu_file parameter -- saves the
                        full unstructured grid (cell-centred) as .vtu/.vtk
                        for ParaView / Zenodo before any rendering.
                        plot_file=*.vtu/.vtk accepted directly (skips
                        plotter).  Added ImportError fallback for HTML export
                        when trame_vtk absent (warns, saves .png instead).
                        Added import math, import os to module imports.
                        Moved plot_model_slices (exact tet-plane intersection,
                        all inner helpers) and plot_borehole_logs from
                        femtic_mod_plot.py into this module; all formerly-
                        implicit config globals are now explicit keyword
                        parameters.  femtic_mod_plot.py reduced to config +
                        thin call wrappers.
    2026-05-27  vrath / Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Anthropic)
                        plot_model_3d: added xlim/ylim/zlim; VTU export and
                        PyVista scene clipped to the same spatial box as the
                        2-D slice panels (pv.clip_box before grid.save and
                        rendering).
                        plot_model_slices: added alpha_file / alpha_mode for
                        polygon-level fading or blanking driven by a second
                        block file (log10 values, <0 = suppress).
    2026-05-31  vrath / Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Anthropic)
                        plot_model_slices, plot_ensemble_slices: added
                        per-panel ``invert_x`` key in slice-spec dicts for
                        ns / ew / plane panels.  Calls ``ax.invert_xaxis()``
                        after rendering, enabling left-right flip for direct
                        comparison with sections from other software.
                        Added highest-point lat/lon diagnostic print.
    2026-05-31  vrath / Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Anthropic)
                        plot_model_slices: actually removed the broken
                        _outline_curtain_top calls from the ns and ew
                        panel branches (the 2026-05-31 changelog entry
                        above claimed removal but the calls were still
                        present).  _outline_curtain_top drew one vertex
                        per polygon connected in x-order, producing dense
                        zigzag lines that appeared as vertical stripes
                        across the full depth of curtain panels.
                        The function definition is retained for reference
                        but is no longer called.
    2026-05-31  vrath / Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Anthropic)
                        read_femtic_mesh: swapped node coordinate columns on
                        read: FEMTIC stores nodes as (id, x=northing,
                        y=easting, z-down); femtic_viz.py uses geographic
                        convention ([:,0]=easting, [:,1]=northing).
                        Confirmed from femtic_make_cutaway_imp.py which
                        uses node_xyz[:,0] as horizontal axis of EW
                        sections (= northing in FEMTIC) and [:,1] for
                        map horizontal axis (= easting).
                        read_femtic_mesh: fixed node and element readers to
                        use the file index (parts[0]) rather than the
                        sequential loop counter, matching femtic.py's
                        read_femtic_mesh.  Same root cause as the
                        resistivity-block bug: if nodes or elements are
                        not stored in strict sequential order the previous
                        code silently assigned coordinates / connectivity
                        to the wrong indices.  _map_node helper removed
                        (no longer needed).
    2026-06-03  Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Anthropic)
                        plot_borehole_logs: (1) z_top="surface" auto-detects
                        the mesh surface elevation at the borehole (x, y)
                        location using a KD-tree nearest-node search on the
                        minimum node-z per x/y column.  (2) Position and
                        elevation appended to each legend / title label
                        (x_m, y_m, z_top_m).  (3) X-axis switched to
                        log-scale (ax.set_xscale("log")); rho is now plotted
                        in Ohm*m rather than log10(Ohm*m), so clim is in
                        Ohm*m too (e.g. [1.0, 1e4]).  BOREHOLE_XLIM in
                        femtic_mod_plot.py updated accordingly.
                        (4) legend shows lat/lon when spec dict contains
                        "lat"/"lon" keys (replaces raw x/y model-local metres
                        in the annotation line).  (5) Per-spec line style:
                        any Matplotlib Line2D kwargs ("color", "ls", "lw",
                        "marker", "alpha", …) placed in the spec dict override
                        the global borehole_style for that trace only.
    2026-06-03  Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Anthropic)
                        plot_borehole_logs: added npz_file parameter for NPZ
                        export of all sampled depth/rho arrays.  Arrays stored
                        as depth_<name> and rho_<name>; JSON header string
                        (model file, mesh file, timestamp, per-borehole meta)
                        stored as scalar string array "header".  npz_file
                        defaults to plot_file with .npz extension when None;
                        falls back to "borehole_logs.npz" when plot_file is
                        also None.  Config vars BOREHOLE_NPZ / BOREHOLE_NPZ_FILE
                        added to femtic_mod_plot_slice.py.
                        Added _sample_borehole_logs() private helper (shared
                        by plot_borehole_logs and plot_model_slices).
                        plot_model_slices: added borehole_sites,
                        borehole_style, borehole_clim, borehole_shared,
                        borehole_resolve_xy parameters; when borehole_sites is
                        non-empty, borehole panels are appended as extra
                        columns to the right of the slice grid in the same
                        figure (one column per borehole when
                        borehole_shared=False, one shared column when True).
                        Fixed _sample_borehole_logs: CRS-tagged x/y positions
                        ("utm", "latlon") now correctly converted jointly
                        via fem.latlon_to_model / fem.utm_to_model rather than
                        the single-axis resolve_pos_x/y (which held the other
                        coordinate at the mesh origin).  lat/lon for the legend
                        now auto-inferred from the CRS tag: latlon → lon from
                        x, lat from y; utm → back-converted via
                        utl.utm_to_latlon_zn.  Explicit "lat"/"lon" spec keys
                        still override the auto-inferred values.
                        plot_borehole_logs: added utm_zone, utm_northern,
                        utm_origin_e, utm_origin_n parameters (passed through
                        to _sample_borehole_logs for CRS conversion without
                        a resolver function).
                        read_resistivity_block: fixed element->region and
                        region->rho assignment to use the index from the
                        file (parts[0]) rather than the sequential loop
                        counter.  When elements or regions are not stored
                        in strict order the previous code silently assigned
                        resistivities to the wrong regions, producing
                        scrambled / uniformly-conductive model plots.
    2026-06-04  vrath / Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Anthropic)
                        Script-level split only: ``femtic_mod_plot_slice.py``
                        drives ``plot_model_slices``; new
                        ``femtic_mod_plot_bh.py`` drives
                        ``plot_borehole_logs``.  Both functions and
                        ``_sample_borehole_logs`` remain in this module.
    2026-06-04  vrath / Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Anthropic)
                        plot_borehole_logs: added ``markers`` parameter for
                        free annotations (arrows + text) on borehole depth
                        axes.  Each marker dict accepts ``depth`` [m] (arrow
                        tip, required), ``rho`` [Ohm*m] (tip x-position),
                        ``rho_text`` [Ohm*m] (text x-position, display units),
                        ``depth_text`` [m] (text y-position, display units),
                        ``text``, ``borehole`` (name or list for targeting),
                        ``arrowprops``, and any ``ax.annotate`` kwargs.
                        Both text positions in natural axis units (Ohm*m / m)
                        so values can be read directly off the axes.
                        Added ``legend_fontsize`` parameter (default 9) that
                        controls the shared-mode legend and per-panel title
                        font size; tick labels scale with it.
    2026-06-07  Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Anthropic)
                        plot_model_ensemble / _draw_slice: replaced ``'type'``
                        key dispatch with ``'kind'`` (accepting ``'map'``,
                        ``'ns'``, ``'ew'``, ``'curtain'``); ``'type'`` still
                        accepted as legacy fallback.  ``'ns'``/``'ew'`` now
                        build the curtain polyline from ``x0``/``y0`` and mesh
                        bounding-box extents, matching the ``plot_model_slices``
                        slice-spec format.  Routing keys ``kind``, ``type``,
                        ``x0``, ``y0``, ``invert_x``, ``title`` are stripped
                        before forwarding to slicer functions.  Docstring
                        updated accordingly.
    2026-06-26  vrath / Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Anthropic)
                        plot_model_slices: added ``tick_fontsize`` (default 7)
                        and ``label_fontsize`` (default 8) parameters;
                        replaced all hardcoded fontsize literals in tick
                        labels, axis labels, panel titles, colourbar label,
                        inline borehole columns, and suptitle.
                        plot_borehole_logs: added ``tick_fontsize`` and
                        ``label_fontsize`` parameters (both default ``None``
                        → derived from ``legend_fontsize``); replaced
                        hardcoded tick / xlabel / ylabel literals.
    2026-07-25  Claude Sonnet 5 (Anthropic)
                        plot_model_slices: fixed depth-axis sign bug in the
                        "ns" and "ew" curtain-panel branches. Polygon
                        y-coordinates are plotted as -depth (positive-down
                        depth negated), but the zlim override applied
                        ax.set_ylim([zlim[1], zlim[0]]) with the *positive*
                        depth values, so the axis range never overlapped
                        the (negative) plotted data whenever zlim was
                        actually set -- panels came out blank or upside
                        down. Both branches now negate zlim to match the
                        data convention: ax.set_ylim([-zlim[1]*dz_sc,
                        -zlim[0]*dz_sc]). No effect when zlim=None (the
                        previous default), which is why this went
                        unnoticed until callers started passing an
                        explicit MOD_ZLIM.
    2026-07-25  Claude Sonnet 5 (Anthropic)
                        plot_ensemble_slices: fixed a second, independent
                        upside-down bug in the "ns"/"ew" curtain panels --
                        this function has its own local _axis_slice_params
                        (separate from plot_model_slices's), which set
                        inv=[True, True, False] for axis 0/1. The resulting
                        v_ax already works out to [0,0,-1] (plotted depth =
                        -depth, 0 at the surface, negative going down),
                        which is already the correct top-shallow /
                        bottom-deep orientation under matplotlib's default
                        axis direction -- so the invert_yaxis() triggered by
                        inv=True was flipping it a second time, putting
                        deep at the top. inv is now [False, False, False]
                        for these two axes. (The "map" panels were never
                        affected -- they don't use invert_v -- and a
                        spot-check of the "plane" panel's invert_v=True at
                        a representative strike/dip suggests it is correctly
                        oriented as-is, since its v_ax sign convention is
                        strike/dip-dependent and differs from the
                        axis-aligned ns/ew case; not exhaustively verified
                        across all strike/dip combinations.) A second,
                        related bug was fixed in the same rendering loop:
                        the per-panel zlim override applied
                        ax.set_ylim([zlim[1], zlim[0]]) using the *positive*
                        depth values directly against the same -depth data
                        convention -- same root cause as the plot_model_
                        slices fix above, just not caught there since it's
                        a separate code path. Now negates zlim to
                        ax.set_ylim([-zlim[1], -zlim[0]]).
    2026-07-25  Claude Sonnet 5 (Anthropic)
                        plot_model_slices / plot_ensemble_slices: added a
                        show parameter (default False). Previously a
                        figure was either saved (plot_file given) or shown
                        interactively (plot_file=None) -- never both, so
                        callers running in an interactive environment
                        (Spyder, Jupyter) that also wanted to save to disk
                        never saw the figure inline. show=True now calls
                        plt.show() in addition to fig.savefig() when
                        plot_file is given (unchanged, save-only, when
                        show=False -- default preserves prior behaviour).
                        plot_ensemble_slices applies this to both the
                        joint figure and per-member figures
                        (per_member_file=True).
    2026-07-25  Claude Sonnet 5 (Anthropic)
                        plot_model_slices: fixed a site-marker elevation
                        sign bug in the "ns"/"ew"/"plane" curtain/plane
                        panels. Mesh polygons plot v = -z_mesh (z positive-
                        down), and since site.dat's elev column is
                        standard positive-up elevation with z_mesh = -elev,
                        a site's correct plotted v-coordinate is
                        -z_mesh = -(-elev) = +elev -- the same sign the
                        mesh polygons already use. The site-marker code
                        instead plotted -elev (the opposite sign): a
                        station on a topographic high (elev > 0) appeared
                        below the surface, and vice versa, while the
                        surrounding topography (drawn from the mesh) was
                        correctly oriented -- an inconsistency that reads
                        as "still upside down" even after the two 2026-07-
                        25 sign fixes above, which only affected the mesh-
                        polygon axis range/orientation, not this separate
                        site-marker computation. Fixed in all three
                        branches (ns/ew: -elev*dz_sc -> elev*dz_sc; plane:
                        same fix, though that panel's own mesh-polygon
                        orientation uses a separate strike/dip-dependent
                        v_ax + invert_v=True convention that was not
                        independently re-verified in this pass).
    2026-07-25  Claude Sonnet 5 (Anthropic)
                        plot_model_slices / plot_ensemble_slices: ns/ew
                        curtain panels' depth axis showed negative tick
                        labels (0, -2.5, -5, ..., -20) even though the
                        vertical orientation itself (shallow top / deep
                        bottom) was already correct after the prior
                        2026-07-25 sign fixes -- the negative numbers came
                        from the internal -depth plot coordinate leaking
                        into the displayed ticks. Added a FuncFormatter
                        (mticker) on the y-axis of ns/ew panels in both
                        functions that displays the tick's positive-down
                        value instead (e.g. internal -15 -> label "15"),
                        so depth reads as positive-down as expected, while
                        the internal plotting convention (needed for
                        correct stacking order) is unchanged. Not applied
                        to "plane" panels (down-dip axis, separate
                        convention, not independently re-verified).
    2026-07-25  Claude Sonnet 5 (Anthropic)
                        plot_model_slices: found and fixed the actual
                        remaining cause of "still upside down" in the
                        "ns"/"ew" curtain panels -- a double negation.
                        _slice_geometry() already projects each 3-D
                        intersection point onto v_ax = [0,0,-1] (see
                        _axis_slice_params), so the "pz" unpacked from its
                        returned polys is already -z_mesh. The polys_d
                        line then negated it AGAIN (-pz), giving effective
                        v = +z_mesh: underground structure (z_mesh large
                        positive, since z is positive-down) landed at
                        large positive v -- entirely outside any sane
                        zlim window like [-20,0] km -- while only the
                        small above-datum sliver (topography, z_mesh
                        slightly negative -> small positive pz -> small
                        negative v after the bad double negation) stayed
                        visible, and with its sense flipped besides. This
                        is exactly what the reported figures showed: a
                        thin wavy (topography-like) coloured strip near
                        the top of the window and a uniform blank/grey
                        field below, even though "map" panels at the same
                        depths (which don't go through this code path)
                        showed real structure throughout. Fixed by using
                        "pz" directly instead of negating it again in both
                        the "ns" and "ew" branches; the "plane" branch was
                        checked and does not have this bug (it passes
                        _slice_geometry's polys straight through with no
                        second transform). No changes needed to the prior
                        zlim-sign fix, the site-marker elevation-sign fix,
                        or the depth-tick-label formatter above -- all of
                        those were built on the (correct, it turns out)
                        assumption that v = -z_mesh, which is what this
                        fix now actually produces.
    2026-07-27  Claude Sonnet 5   plot_model_slices: added plt.close(fig)
                        after savefig/show (matching plot_ensemble_slices)
                        and now returns fig. Previously the figure was
                        never closed, so per-member loops in
                        femtic_rto_prep.py / femtic_gst_prep.py
                        (_plot_member_slices, called once per VIZ_SAMPLES
                        entry for QC and model plots) leaked one open
                        figure per call, triggering matplotlib's "more
                        than 20 figures opened" RuntimeWarning and
                        growing memory use over long ensemble runs.
    2026-08-10  Claude Sonnet 5   Fixed N-S curtain panels ("ns" kind)
                        plotting mirrored left-right relative to true
                        geography, in both plot_model_slices' and
                        plot_ensemble_slices' copies of the nested
                        _axis_slice_params() helper. cross(n, ref) with
                        the shared ref=[0,0,1] gives u=[0,-1,0] (negative
                        northing) for axis 0 ("ns") but u=[1,0,0]
                        (positive easting) for axis 1 ("ew") -- an
                        artefact never compensated downstream, so
                        increasing real northing plotted left instead of
                        right while the S(left)/N(right) compass labels
                        (plot_model_slices only) assumed the untouched
                        convention. Verified against a real model: a
                        resistive body at positive y/north plotted on
                        the "S" side of the N-S curtain in two ensemble
                        QC figures, and confirmed against its correct
                        position in the corresponding map panels of the
                        same dataset. Fix flips u only for axis 0 (not
                        v, which the already-fixed depth handling
                        relies on being [0,0,-1]). "ew" and "map" panels
                        were unaffected and are unchanged. Also added a
                        tick_decimals parameter to both functions
                        (None -> unchanged formatting) to control the
                        number of decimal digits shown on depth,
                        easting/northing, and (plot_model_slices only)
                        lat/lon tick labels.
    2026-08-12  Claude Sonnet 5 (Anthropic)
                        Added plot_convergence_bar(): standalone bar
                        chart of per-member nRMS (from femtic.cnv),
                        coloured by status ("accepted" / "rejected_nrms"
                        / "missing_cnv" / "missing_model", inferred from
                        a threshold when not supplied explicitly).
                        Accepts members with no usable nRMS (None/NaN)
                        alongside numeric ones so the ensemble scan loop
                        in femtic_ens_post.py doesn't need to filter
                        first; missing members render as a small hatched
                        stub bar annotated "n/a" rather than vanishing.
                        Sortable by nRMS (ascending, missing sort last)
                        or by original scan order; optional dashed
                        threshold line (e.g. NRMS_MAX) and per-bar value
                        labels. No changes to any existing function.
    2026-08-12  Claude Sonnet 5 (Anthropic)
                        Added plot_convergence_histogram(): binned,
                        stacked-by-status companion to
                        plot_convergence_bar for large ensembles where a
                        one-bar-per-member chart becomes a wall of rows.
                        Bins nRMS into "auto" (default, 15) or a fixed
                        number of equal-width bins spanning the finite
                        nRMS range, stacks accepted/rejected_nrms counts
                        per bin, and tallies members with no usable nRMS
                        (None/NaN) into one extra "missing" bar appended
                        after the last numeric bin (split further by
                        missing_cnv/missing_model if both are present)
                        rather than dropping them. Same status ->
                        color/hatch/legend convention as
                        plot_convergence_bar; the shared default map is
                        now factored into a new _conv_status_style_map()
                        module helper, used by both functions (no
                        behaviour change to plot_convergence_bar itself).
                        Optional dashed threshold line, per-bar count
                        labels, log-y option. Now femtic_ens_post.py's
                        default MOD_CONV rendering (MOD_CONV_PER_MEMBER
                        =True switches back to plot_convergence_bar).
    2026-08-12  Claude Sonnet 5 (Anthropic)
                        plot_convergence_histogram(): changed the bin
                        range to cover only members whose status is in
                        the new binned_statuses parameter (default just
                        ("accepted",)) instead of the full finite nRMS
                        range. Rejected members ("rejected_nrms") no
                        longer get real bins at all -- they're always
                        lumped into one aggregate "rejected" bar (new
                        show_rejected_bar parameter, default True),
                        appended after the numeric bins next to the
                        existing "missing" aggregate bar, mirroring how
                        missing members were already handled. Rationale:
                        a single far-over-threshold member could
                        otherwise stretch the shared bin range and
                        compress the entire accepted population into an
                        unreadable sliver at one edge of the plot.
                        Renamed/removed the old status_order parameter
                        (no longer meaningful now that only
                        binned_statuses gets real bins); no other public
                        parameters changed. plot_convergence_bar is
                        unaffected."""

    """Joint plot of original and perturbed MT data for a fixed list of samples.

    Produces a 2-D grid of axes: **rows** = ensemble members (one per entry in
    *sample_indices*); **columns** = plot panels (one per entry in *what*).
    Within each cell the original curves (solid) and the perturbed curves
    (dashed) for a randomly drawn subset of MT sites are overlaid on the same
    axes.

    Follows the ``data_viz`` philosophy: if *fig* / *axs* are provided they
    are used directly; otherwise a new figure is created.  ``(fig, axs)`` is
    always returned so the caller can annotate or save.

    Parameters
    ----------
    orig_file : str or Path
        Path to the reference ``observe.dat`` (template / original data).
    ens_files : sequence of str or Path
        Paths to the perturbed ``observe.dat`` files, one per ensemble member.
    sample_indices : sequence of int
        Indices into ``ens_files`` that should be plotted (e.g. ``[0, 3, 7]``).
    what : str or sequence of str, optional
        Which MT quantity (or quantities) to plot.  Each entry must be one of
        ``'rho'``, ``'phase'``, ``'tipper'``, ``'pt'``.  A plain string is
        treated as a single-panel request.  A list produces one column per
        entry, e.g. ``['rho', 'phase']`` gives a two-column layout with
        apparent resistivity on the left and phase on the right.
        Default is ``'rho'``.
    comps : str or sequence of str, optional
        Impedance components for ``'rho'`` / ``'phase'`` columns.
        A single string (e.g. ``'xy,yx'``) is used for every ``'rho'`` /
        ``'phase'`` column.  A sequence of the same length as *what* provides
        per-column control; use ``None`` or ``''`` for ``'tipper'`` /
        ``'pt'`` columns (the value is ignored for those plotters anyway).
        Default is ``'xy,yx'``.
    show_errors : bool, optional
        Shorthand for both ``show_errors_orig`` and ``show_errors_pert``.
        Default ``False``.
    show_errors_orig : bool or None, optional
        If ``True``, draw error envelopes on the **original** curves.
        Overrides ``show_errors``.  Default ``None`` (falls back to
        ``show_errors``).
    show_errors_pert : bool or None, optional
        If ``True``, draw error envelopes on the **perturbed** curves.
        Overrides ``show_errors``.  Default ``None``.
    error_style_orig : str, optional
        Error rendering for the **original** curves: ``'shade'`` (default),
        ``'bar'``, or ``'both'``.
    error_style_pert : str, optional
        Error rendering for the **perturbed** curves: ``'shade'`` (default),
        ``'bar'``, or ``'both'``.
    n_sites : int or None, optional
        Number of MT sites drawn (without replacement) per row.  The same
        random subset is used across all columns in a row.  ``None`` = all
        sites.
    alpha_orig : float, optional
        Opacity for the **original** curves (default ``1.0``).
    alpha_pert : float, optional
        Opacity for the **perturbed** curves (default ``0.6``).
    comp_markers : dict or None, optional
        Marker symbols keyed by component class (``'ii'``, ``'ij'``,
        ``'inv'``).  ``None`` uses :data:`DEFAULT_COMP_MARKERS`; ``{}``
        disables markers.  Partial dicts are merged with the defaults.
    markersize : float, optional
        Marker size in points (default ``4.0``).
    markevery : int or None, optional
        Mark every *N*-th period; ``None`` = every period.
    perlims : (float, float) or None, optional
        Period-axis limits ``(T_min, T_max)`` in seconds applied to every
        panel via ``ax.set_xlim``.  ``None`` = Matplotlib auto-scaling.
    rholims : (float, float) or None, optional
        y-axis limits for ``'rho'`` panels (apparent resistivity, Ohm*m or
        log10(Ohm*m) depending on the plotter).  ``None`` = auto.
    phslims : (float, float) or None, optional
        y-axis limits for ``'phase'`` panels (degrees).  ``None`` = auto.
    vtflims : (float, float) or None, optional
        y-axis limits for ``'tipper'`` panels.  ``None`` = auto.
    ptlims : (float, float) or None, optional
        y-axis limits for ``'pt'`` panels.  ``None`` = auto.
    figsize : (float, float) or None, optional
        Figure size.  Auto-sized if ``None``:
        width ~ 5 x n_panels, height ~ 3 x n_samples.
    fig : matplotlib.figure.Figure or None, optional
        Pre-existing figure.  If ``None`` a new one is created.
    axs : array-like of Axes or None, optional
        Pre-allocated axes of shape ``(n_samples, n_panels)`` (or ravelled
        equivalent).  If ``None``, subplots are created automatically.
    tick_fontsize : int, optional
        Font size for axis tick labels.  Default ``8``.
    label_fontsize : int, optional
        Font size for panel titles and legends.  Default ``9``.
    out : bool, optional
        Print progress messages.

    Returns
    -------
    fig : matplotlib.figure.Figure
    axs : numpy.ndarray of matplotlib.axes.Axes
        Shape ``(n_samples, n_panels)``.  When *what* is a single string the
        shape is ``(n_samples, 1)`` -- index with ``axs[:, 0]`` if you need the
        1-D array of rows.

    Notes
    -----
    **Component markers** are applied post-hoc (snapshot ``ax.lines`` before
    each plotter call, patch the new ``Line2D`` objects after) to avoid a
    ``TypeError`` from any hardcoded ``marker=`` argument inside ``data_viz``.

    **Error styles** ``'bar'`` / ``'both'`` require the ``data_viz`` plotter
    to accept an ``error_style`` kwarg; otherwise falls back to ``'shade'``
    with a one-time ``warnings.warn``.

    Data files are read via :func:`femtic.observe_to_site_viz_list` (through
    ``_observe_to_site_list``).  FEMTIC stores Z in SI Ohm; the helper converts
    to mV/km/nT before passing to ``data_viz.datadict_to_plot_df``.

    """Joint plot of original and perturbed resistivity models.

    Produces a grid of Matplotlib axes: **rows** = 2 x number of selected
    samples (original row then perturbed row per block); **columns** = number
    of slices.  Original and perturbed models are placed directly above/below
    each other for easy visual comparison across all requested slices.

    Follows the ``data_viz`` philosophy: if *fig* / *axs* are provided they
    are used directly; otherwise a new figure is created.  ``(fig, axs)`` is
    always returned.

    Parameters
    ----------
    orig_mod_file : str or Path
        Path to the reference (template) ``resistivity_block_iterX.dat``.
    ens_mod_files : sequence of str or Path
        Paths to the perturbed resistivity block files, one per ensemble member.
    mesh_file : str or Path
        Path to the shared ``mesh.dat``.
    sample_indices : sequence of int
        Indices into ``ens_mod_files`` to visualise (e.g. ``[0, 2, 5]``).
    slices : sequence of dict
        Between 1 and 5 slice descriptors.  Each dict must have a ``'kind'``
        key (preferred) or legacy ``'type'`` key identifying the panel type:

        - ``'map'``     – horizontal depth slice; position key: ``z0`` (m, positive-down).
        - ``'ns'``      – N-S vertical section;   position key: ``x0`` (easting, m).
        - ``'ew'``      – E-W vertical section;   position key: ``y0`` (northing, m).
        - ``'curtain'`` – arbitrary profile;       position key: ``'polyline'`` array.

        Examples::

            dict(kind='map', z0=5000.)
            dict(kind='ns',  x0=0.)
            dict(kind='ew',  y0=0.)
            {'type': 'curtain',
             'polyline': np.array([[x0, y0], [x1, y1]]),
             'width': 500}

    mode : {'scatter', 'tri', 'grid'}, optional
        Slice rendering mode forwarded to the slicer functions.  Default
        is ``'tri'``.
    log10 : bool, optional
        Plot log10(rho) if ``True`` (default).
    cmap : str or None, optional
        Matplotlib colormap (default ``'jet_r'``).
    clim : (float, float) or None, optional
        Colour limits ``(vmin, vmax)`` in log10(Ohm*m).
        If ``None``, limits are derived from the original model.
    xlim : (float, float) or None, optional
        x-axis limits applied to **map** slices (easting range, metres).
        If ``None``, Matplotlib auto-scales.  Individual slice dicts may
        also carry an ``'xlim'`` key to override per-slice.
    ylim : (float, float) or None, optional
        y-axis limits applied to **map** slices (northing range, metres).
        For **curtain** slices this sets the along-profile distance axis
        (horizontal axis).  Individual slice dicts may carry a ``'ylim'`` key.
    zlim : (float, float) or None, optional
        Depth-axis limits applied to **curtain** slices (vertical axis, metres,
        negative-down convention).  Individual slice dicts may carry a
        ``'zlim'`` key.
    mesh_lines : bool, optional
        If ``True``, overlay the Delaunay triangulation edges (``ax.triplot``)
        on top of the filled patches in ``mode='tri'`` panels.  Useful for
        inspecting mesh resolution in ensemble diagnostics.  Default ``False``.
        Per-slice dicts may carry a ``'mesh_lines'`` key to override per-slice.
    mesh_lw : float, optional
        Line width for the mesh edge overlay (default ``0.3``).
    mesh_color : str, optional
        Colour for the mesh edge overlay (default ``'k'``).
    ocean_color : str or None, optional
        Flat colour for ocean cells across all panels (default ``'lightgrey'``).
        Forwarded to the slicer functions.  Set to None to use the colormap.
    ocean_value : float, optional
        Resistivity (Ohm*m) identifying ocean cells (default 0.3).
    figsize : (float, float) or None, optional
        Figure size in inches.  If ``None``, a sensible default is chosen.
    fig : matplotlib.figure.Figure or None, optional
        Pre-existing figure.
    axs : array-like of Axes or None, optional
        Pre-allocated axes of shape
        ``(2 * len(sample_indices), len(slices))``.
        If ``None``, subplots are created automatically.
    tick_fontsize : int, optional
        Font size for axis tick labels.  Default ``8``.
    label_fontsize : int, optional
        Font size for panel titles and row labels.  Default ``8``.
    out : bool, optional
        If ``True``, print progress messages.

    Returns
    -------
    fig : matplotlib.figure.Figure
    axs : numpy.ndarray of matplotlib.axes.Axes
        Shape ``(2 * len(sample_indices), len(slices))``.

    Notes
    -----
    The mesh is read once and shared across all samples and slices.
    Colour limits are optionally set globally from the original model so that
    all panels are directly comparable.

    Produces axis-aligned slices (any combination of x, y, z planes),
    arbitrary oblique planes, and iso-surfaces of ``log10_resistivity``
    (or any other cell-data scalar).

    Parameters
    ----------
    mesh_file, block_file
        Paths to ``mesh.dat`` and ``resistivity_block_iterX.dat``.
    scalar
        Cell-data scalar to display.  ``"log10_resistivity"`` (default) or
        ``"resistivity"``.  Must be present on the PyVista grid -- both are
        attached by :func:`unstructured_grid_from_femtic`.
    clim
        Colour limits ``(vmin, vmax)`` for the scalar.
        ``None`` -> PyVista auto.
    cmap
        Matplotlib / PyVista colormap name for slices (default ``"turbo_r"``).
    slice_x
        List of x-positions (model-local metres) at which to cut YZ planes.
        ``None`` or empty -> no x-slices.
    slice_y
        List of y-positions (model-local metres) at which to cut XZ planes.
        ``None`` or empty -> no y-slices.
    slice_z
        List of z-positions (model-local metres, z positive-down) at which
        to cut XY planes.  ``None`` or empty -> no z-slices.
    slice_planes
        List of dicts for arbitrary oblique planes.  Each dict may contain:

        - ``"origin"`` : ``[x, y, z]`` -- point on the plane (model-local m).
          Defaults to mesh centre.
        - ``"normal"`` : ``[nx, ny, nz]`` -- plane normal vector.
          Defaults to ``[0, 1, 0]`` (YZ plane).

        Example::

            slice_planes = [
                dict(origin=[0., 0., 10000.], normal=[1., 1., 0.]),
            ]

    isovalues
        Scalar values at which to draw iso-surfaces.  For
        ``scalar="log10_resistivity"`` these are in log10(Ohm*m) -- e.g.
        ``[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]`` for 10 / 100 / 1000 Ohm*m boundaries.
        ``None`` or empty -> no iso-surfaces.
    iso_opacity
        Opacity for iso-surfaces (0 = transparent, 1 = opaque).
    iso_cmap
        Colormap for iso-surface colouring (defaults to same as ``cmap``).
    show_edges
        Overlay mesh edges on slices (slow for large meshes).
    edge_color, edge_lw
        Colour and line-width for mesh edges when ``show_edges=True``.
    background
        Background colour string (default ``"white"``).
    window_size
        Plotter window resolution ``(width, height)`` in pixels.
    ocean_value
        Resistivity (Ohm*m) used to sentinel-mark ocean cells in
        :func:`prepare_rho_for_plotting`.
    air_region_index, ocean_region_index
        Region indices for air and ocean masking.
    xlim, ylim, zlim
        Optional spatial clipping bounds in model-local metres
        ``[min, max]``.  When set, both the VTU export and the PyVista
        scene are clipped to the box defined by these limits (using
        ``pv.UnstructuredGrid.clip_box``).  Air / padding cells outside

        the 2-D slice panels (which use the same ``PLOT_XLIM`` /
        ``PLOT_YLIM`` / ``PLOT_ZLIM`` limits).  ``None`` = no clipping
        along that axis (full mesh extent used).
    plot_file
        Output path for the rendered view.  Recognised extensions:

        - ``.vtu`` / ``.vtk``  -> VTK unstructured-grid file of the full 3-D
          volume (no rendering; same as setting ``vtu_file``).
        - ``.html``  -> interactive WebGL scene (requires ``pyvista[jupyter]``
          / ``trame_vtk``; falls back to ``.png`` if unavailable).
        - ``.png`` / ``.jpg`` / ``.svg`` -> static screenshot.
        - ``None``  -> open an interactive PyVista window.

    vtu_file
        If given, the full unstructured grid (all cell-data arrays, including
        ``resistivity`` and ``log10_resistivity``) is saved as a VTK XML
        unstructured-grid (``.vtu``) or legacy VTK (``.vtk``) file **in
        addition to** any ``plot_file`` output.  Suitable for ParaView,
        Zenodo data deposits, or publication supplementary material.
        ``None`` -> no grid export.

    screenshot_scale
        Anti-aliasing scale factor for screenshot modes (default 2 = 2x resolution).
    out
        Print progress messages when ``True``.

    Returns
    -------
    pl : pv.Plotter or None
        The PyVista Plotter object (already closed / exported when ``plot_file``
        is set).  Returns ``None`` when PyVista is unavailable.

    Raises
    ------
    ImportError
        If PyVista is not importable and ``plot_file`` is not ``None`` (i.e. when
        an output file was requested; interactive use silently returns ``None``).

    """Sample resistivity along vertical boreholes and return log dicts.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nodes, conn, rho_plot
        Mesh arrays as returned by ``read_femtic_mesh`` /
        ``prepare_rho_for_plotting``.
    borehole_sites
        List of spec dicts (see ``plot_borehole_logs`` for full key docs).
        ``"x"`` and ``"y"`` accept:

        - plain ``float``          → model-local metres
        - ``(value, "model")``     → model-local metres
        - ``(E_m, "utm")``         → UTM easting / northing (both must be utm)
        - ``(lon, "latlon")``      → geographic lon for x, lat for y
          (both must carry the same "latlon" tag; joint conversion via
          ``femtic.latlon_to_model``)

        The CRS tags on ``"x"`` and ``"y"`` **must match**; mixing tags
        across the two keys raises ``ValueError``.

        When ``"lat"`` / ``"lon"`` keys are explicitly in the spec they take
        priority for the legend.  When the CRS is ``"latlon"`` or ``"utm"``
        the geographic position is inferred automatically for the legend
        (lon from ``"x"``, lat from ``"y"`` for latlon; back-converted from
        UTM for utm).
    resolve_xy_fn
        Optional ``(spec) -> (x_m, y_m)`` override.  When provided it takes
        complete precedence over the built-in CRS logic; ``"lat"``/``"lon"``
        spec keys are still used for the legend if present.
    utm_zone, utm_northern
        UTM zone and hemisphere — required for ``"utm"`` and ``"latlon"``
        conversions.
    utm_origin_e, utm_origin_n
        UTM coordinates of the mesh centre [m] — required for ``"utm"`` and
        ``"latlon"`` conversions.
    out
        Print progress.

    Returns
    -------
    list of dicts, one per borehole, with keys:
        name, pos_str, x_m, y_m, z_top, z_bot, dz, lat, lon,

    """Produce a multi-panel figure of axis-parallel FEMTIC model slices.

    Uses exact tetrahedron-plane intersection -- no selection slab, no dw.
    Every tetrahedron straddling the plane contributes an exact triangle or
    quadrilateral polygon.

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_file, mesh_file
        Resistivity block and mesh.dat paths.
    slices
        List of slice-spec dicts with model-local positions (pre-processed
        by ``fem.resolve_slice_positions``).  Each dict must contain
        ``"kind"`` (``"map"``, ``"ns"``, ``"ew"``, ``"plane"``) and the
        corresponding position keys (``z0``, ``x0``, ``y0``,
        ``point`` / ``strike`` / ``dip``).
    cmap
        Matplotlib colormap name.
    clim
        ``[log10_min, log10_max]``; ``None`` = auto from data.
    xlim, ylim, zlim
        Global axis limits (model-local m); per-panel ``"xlim"`` etc.
        override these.
    ocean_color
        Flat colour for ocean polygon overlay; ``None`` -> use colormap.
    ocean_value
        Ohm*m sentinel for ocean cells (must match inversion setup).
    air_color
        Flat colour for air (above-ground) polygon overlay.  Every element
        whose resistivity exceeds 1e8 Ohm*m is treated as air and rendered
        in this colour (default ``"white"``).  ``None`` -> air polygons are
        not drawn (old behaviour -- leaves blank gaps).
    air_bgcolor
        Axes facecolor for the air region; ``None`` = figure default.
    site_xys
        List of ``(label, x_m, y_m, elev_m)`` tuples in model-local
        metres.  ``None`` / empty -> no markers.
    obs_coords_only
        ``True`` when *site_xys* come from ``observe.dat`` (model-local
        only); suppresses ``"utm"`` / ``"latlon"`` display for markers.
    projection_dist
        Maximum distance [m] from a curtain/plane for a site to appear on
        that panel.  ``None`` = all sites on all panels.
    sites_in_maps, sites_in_slices
        Enable site markers on map and curtain/plane panels respectively.
    site_marker
        Matplotlib ``plot`` kwargs for map-panel site markers.
        Default: ``dict(marker="v", color="black", ms=4, zorder=10)``.
    site_marker_slices
        Matplotlib ``plot`` kwargs for curtain/plane site markers.
        Default: ``dict(marker="o", color="black", ms=4, zorder=10)``.
    map_markers
        List of extra point-marker dicts overlaid on map panels only.
        Each dict: ``"latlon"`` ([lat, lon]), ``"marker"``, ``"color"``,
        ``"ms"``, ``"name"`` (legend label or ``None``).
    display_coords
        ``"model"`` (model-local m), ``"utm"`` (absolute UTM km), or
        ``"latlon"`` (decimal degrees).
    utm_origin_e, utm_origin_n
        UTM easting / northing of the mesh centre [m].
    utm_zone, utm_northern
        UTM zone number and hemisphere flag for coordinate formatting.
    utm_to_latlon_fn
        Callable ``(E_m, N_m, zone, northern) -> (lat, lon)`` used for
        lat/lon tick formatting.  ``None`` -> no lat/lon formatter.
    latlon_to_model_fn
        Callable ``(lat, lon, zone, northern, origin_e, origin_n)
        -> (x_m, y_m)`` used to place ``map_markers``.  ``None`` -> markers
        skipped when ``display_coords != "model"``.
    plot_file
        Save path; ``None`` = interactive ``show()`` (equivalent to
        ``show=True`` with no save). When ``plot_file`` is given *and*
        ``show=True``, the figure is both saved and displayed.
    dpi
        Saved-figure DPI.
    equal_aspect
        Call ``ax.set_aspect("equal")`` on map/ns/ew panels when both axes
        carry the same physical scale.
    depth_km
        Show depth axis in km on curtain and plane panels.
    horiz_km
        Show horizontal axes in km when ``display_coords="model"``.
    nrows, ncols
        Subplot grid shape; ``None`` = 1 x n_panels.  Surplus cells hidden.
    panel_height
        Row height in inches.
    panel_width
        Fixed column width in inches; ``None`` = auto from aspect ratio.
    figsize
        Explicit ``[width, height]`` in inches; overrides auto sizing.
    alpha_file
        Optional path to a second ``resistivity_block_iterX.dat`` file with
        the **same mesh and region structure** as ``model_file``.  Its
        resistivity values are interpreted as **log10 weights** (the raw
        region_rho values are treated directly as log10 numbers; values
        < 0 suppress a polygon, values >= 0 keep it fully visible).
        Typical use: pass a misfit or sensitivity block whose values have
        been stored in log10 form so that cells with poor data coverage or
        high misfit are faded or removed.  ``None`` -> no alpha modulation.
    alpha_mode
        How ``alpha_file`` values drive polygon visibility:

        - ``"fade"``  -- polygon alpha = ``clip(log10_val / alpha_blank_thresh, 0, 1)``
          when ``alpha_blank_thresh < 0``; polygons with ``log10_val >= 0`` are
          fully opaque, polygons with ``log10_val < alpha_blank_thresh`` are
          fully transparent.  Intermediate values produce proportional fading.
        - ``"blank"`` -- hard threshold: polygons with ``log10_val < alpha_blank_thresh``
          are omitted entirely; all others are fully opaque.

        Default ``"fade"``.
    alpha_blank_thresh
        Log10 threshold (<= 0) below which polygons are blanked / fully faded.
        Default ``0.0`` (any negative log10 value triggers suppression).
    mesh_outline
        If ``True`` (default), draw a thin convex-hull outline around the
        intersection polygons on **map** panels and a top-edge polyline on
        **ns** / **ew** curtain panels.  This makes the data footprint visible
        and distinguishes "above topography / outside mesh" from coloured data.
        Requires SciPy (``ConvexHull``); silently skipped when absent.
    mesh_outline_color
        Matplotlib colour string for the outline (default ``"0.35"``).
    borehole_sites
        Optional list of borehole spec dicts (same format as accepted by
        ``plot_borehole_logs``).  When non-empty, borehole panels are
        appended as extra columns to the **right** of the slice grid inside
        the same figure.

        ``borehole_shared=True``  → one extra column, all traces overlaid.
        ``borehole_shared=False`` → one extra column per borehole.

        The borehole column(s) share the depth y-axis scale with the
        leftmost curtain / plane panel present (if any); when only map
        panels are present the y-axis is an independent depth axis.
        ``None`` / empty list → no borehole columns.
    borehole_style
        Baseline Matplotlib ``Line2D`` kwargs for all borehole traces.
        Default: ``lw=1.2, marker="none"``.
    borehole_clim
        ``[rho_min, rho_max]`` in Ohm*m for the borehole x-axis (log scale).
        ``None`` = auto.
    borehole_shared
        ``True``  → all borehole traces on one extra column.
        ``False`` → one extra column per borehole.
    borehole_resolve_xy
        Optional ``(spec) -> (x_m, y_m)`` CRS converter.
        ``None`` = x/y already model-local floats.
    tick_fontsize
        Font size for axis tick labels (main panels and colourbar).
        Default 7.
    label_fontsize
        Font size for axis labels, panel titles, colourbar label, and
        suptitle.  Default 8.
    tick_decimals
        Number of decimal digits shown on axis tick labels -- depth,
        map/curtain easting-northing (model or UTM units), and lat/lon
        (when ``display_coords="latlon"``) all use the same value.
        ``None`` (default) keeps the previous per-axis-type formatting
        unchanged: ``:g`` auto-precision for depth, plain Matplotlib
        auto-ticks for easting/northing, ``.3f`` for lat/lon.
    nrms_annotation
        Optional dict with keys ``nrms`` (float), ``alpha`` (float), and
        ``panel`` (int or None).  When set, a text box reading
        ``nRMS = <value>  (α = <alpha>)`` is placed in the lower-left
        corner of the panel at index ``panel`` (default: 0).
    figure_title
        Overall figure title (suptitle).  ``None`` → the basename of
        *model_file*.
    show
        If True, also display the figure interactively via
        ``plt.show()`` -- in addition to saving, when ``plot_file`` is
        also given. Useful in interactive environments (e.g. Spyder,
        Jupyter) where saving to disk shouldn't preclude also seeing the
        figure inline. Default False (save-only, matching prior
        behaviour) when ``plot_file`` is given.
    out
        Print progress messages.

    """Produce a 1-D rho vs depth figure for a list of boreholes (log x-axis).

    Resistivity is sampled at regular depth intervals using
    ``fem.extract_borehole_log`` (point-in-element, exact barycentric test).
    Air / out-of-mesh levels appear as gaps (NaN).

    The x-axis is logarithmic and shows rho in Ohm*m.  The y-axis shows depth
    in km increasing downward from z_top.

    Sampled data are always exported to an NPZ file before any plotting.  The
    NPZ contains one ``depth_<name>`` and one ``rho_<name>`` array per
    borehole, plus a scalar string array ``header`` with a JSON metadata
    block (model file, mesh file, creation timestamp, per-borehole geometry).

    Parameters
    ----------
    model_file, mesh_file
        Resistivity block and mesh.dat paths.
    borehole_sites
        List of borehole spec dicts.  Each dict must contain:

        ``"name"`` (str), ``"x"`` and ``"y"`` (model-local m or as returned
        by *resolve_xy_fn*), ``"z_top"``, ``"z_bot"``, ``"dz"`` (all in
        model-local metres, z positive-down).

        **Optional spec keys:**

        ``"z_top"`` may be the string ``"surface"`` (case-insensitive).  In
        that case z_top is auto-detected as the minimum mesh node z at the
        borehole (x, y) location using a KD-tree nearest-column search.

        ``"lat"`` and ``"lon"`` (floats, decimal degrees) — when present, the
        legend / panel title shows geographic coordinates instead of model-local
        x/y metres.

        Any Matplotlib ``Line2D`` keyword (``"color"``, ``"ls"``,
        ``"linestyle"``, ``"lw"``, ``"linewidth"``, ``"marker"``, ``"alpha"``,
        ``"zorder"``, …) placed directly in the spec dict overrides the global
        *borehole_style* for that trace only.

        The legend / panel title is always annotated with position and surface
        elevation so that the figure is self-documenting.
    resolve_xy_fn
        Optional callable ``(spec) -> (x_m, y_m)`` that fully overrides the
        built-in CRS conversion.  When ``None`` the helper converts CRS-tagged
        ``"x"``/``"y"`` values directly using *utm_zone* / *utm_origin_e* /
        *utm_origin_n*.
    utm_zone, utm_northern
        UTM zone number and hemisphere flag.  Required when any spec uses
        ``(value, "utm")`` or ``(value, "latlon")`` CRS tags and
        *resolve_xy_fn* is ``None``.
    utm_origin_e, utm_origin_n
        UTM easting / northing of the mesh centre [m].  Required for the
        same CRS tag cases.
    ocean_value
        Ohm*m sentinel for ocean cells.
    clim
        ``[rho_min, rho_max]`` in Ohm*m for the x-axis; ``None`` = auto.
        Example: ``[1.0, 1e4]``.
    borehole_style
        Matplotlib line kwargs applied as the baseline style for every trace.
        Per-spec keys in ``borehole_sites`` override these for individual
        traces.  Default baseline: ``lw=1.2, marker="none"``.
    shared
        ``True`` -> all boreholes on one axes; ``False`` -> one panel each.
    markers
        Optional list of free-annotation dicts placed on the depth axis after
        all traces are drawn.  Each dict may contain:

        ``"depth"``  (float, **required**) — depth in **metres** (z-down) at
        which the annotation is placed.  Converted to km internally.

        ``"rho"``  (float, optional) — x-position of the arrow tip in Ohm·m.
        When omitted the annotation is placed at the left edge of the x-axis.

        ``"text"``  (str, optional, default ``""``) — annotation string.

        ``"borehole"``  (str or list of str, optional) — borehole ``"name"``
        value(s) this marker applies to.  When omitted (or ``None``) the
        marker is placed on **all** panels (or on the shared axes when
        ``shared=True``).

        ``"rho_text"``  (float, optional) — x-position of the annotation text
        in Ohm·m (same log-scale units as the x-axis).  When omitted the text
        is placed at ``rho * 3`` (roughly half a decade to the right on a log
        axis), or at ``xlim[0] * 3`` when ``"rho"`` is also absent.

        ``"depth_text"``  (float, optional) — y-position of the annotation
        text in **metres** (z-down), converted to km internally.  When omitted
        the text is placed 300 m above the tip
        (i.e. ``depth - 300``).

        Both positions are in the natural display units of the axes — Ohm·m
        for x and metres (stored as km) for y — so you can read the values
        directly off the plot axes when choosing them.

        Any remaining keys are forwarded verbatim to ``ax.annotate`` as
        keyword arguments (e.g. ``arrowprops``, ``color``, ``fontsize``,
        ``ha``, ``va``, ``fontweight``, …).  When ``arrowprops`` is absent a
        default thin black arrow is drawn.

        Example::

            markers = [
                dict(depth=1500., rho=10., text="conductor",
                     rho_text=30., depth_text=1200.,
                     borehole="borehole1",
                     color="red", fontsize=8, fontweight="bold",
                     arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle="->", color="red", lw=1.2)),
                dict(depth=3000., rho_text=500., depth_text=2600.,
                     text="resistive basement", color="navy"),
            ]

    legend_fontsize
        Font size for the borehole legend (shared mode) and panel titles
        (per-panel mode).  Default ``9``.
    tick_fontsize
        Font size for axis tick labels.  ``None`` → ``legend_fontsize - 2``
        (clamped to at least 6).
    label_fontsize
        Font size for axis labels and standalone titles.  ``None`` →
        ``legend_fontsize``.
    figure_title
        Overall figure title (suptitle).  ``None`` → the basename of
        *model_file*.
    npz_file
        Path for the NPZ data export.

        * explicit path  → saved there.
        * ``None``       → derived from *plot_file* by replacing its extension
          with ``.npz``; if *plot_file* is also ``None`` the file is written
          as ``"borehole_logs.npz"`` in the current working directory.

        Set to ``False`` to suppress NPZ export entirely.
    plot_file
        Save path for the figure; ``None`` = interactive ``show()``.
    dpi
        Figure DPI.
    out
        Print progress messages.

    """Produce a joint ensemble figure using exact tetrahedron-plane intersection.

    Layout: one row per ensemble member, followed by optional statistical
    summary rows (mean, std, median of log10(rho) across all members).
    Columns correspond to the entries of *slices* -- the same slice-spec list
    used by ``femtic_mod_plot.plot_model_slices``.

    The mesh is parsed **once** and slice polygon geometry is precomputed
    **once** per slice position; only the per-element resistivity vector is
    swapped for each member, making the function efficient for large meshes.

    Parameters
    ----------
    member_files
        List of paths to ``resistivity_block_iterX.dat`` files, one per member.
    mesh_file
        Path to the shared ``mesh.dat``.
    slices
        List of slice-spec dicts with all positions already in model-local metres
        (pre-process with ``femtic_mod_plot.resolve_slices`` when using CRS-tagged
        positions).  Each dict must contain at least ``"kind"`` and the
        corresponding position key (``z0`` / ``x0`` / ``y0`` / ``point``).
        Optional per-panel ``xlim`` / ``ylim`` / ``zlim`` / ``title`` keys are
        honoured.
    labels
        Row label strings, one per member.  ``None`` -> "Member 0", "Member 1", ...
    stat_rows
        Stat-summary rows appended after all member rows.  Any subset of
        ``"mean"``, ``"std"``, ``"median"`` in any order.  Pass ``()`` for no
        stat rows.
    cmap
        Matplotlib colormap name for member and mean/median rows.
    clim
        ``[vmin, vmax]`` in log10(Ohm*m).  ``None`` -> auto from ensemble range.
    xlim, ylim, zlim
        Global axis limits in model-local metres; per-panel keys override.
    ocean_color
        Flat colour for ocean/lake cells.  ``None`` -> use colormap.
    ocean_value
        Resistivity sentinel (Ohm*m) identifying ocean cells (default 0.25 Ohm*m).
    air_bgcolor
        Axes facecolor shown through transparent air cells.  ``None`` = figure default.
    plot_file
        Joint figure output path.  ``None`` -> interactive ``plt.show()``.
    per_member_file
        If ``True`` and *plot_file* is set, also save one single-row figure per
        member.  File names are derived from *plot_file* by inserting
        ``_memberN`` before the extension.
    dpi
        Saved-figure DPI.
    tick_fontsize
        Font size for axis tick labels and colourbar ticks.  Default ``6``.
    label_fontsize
        Font size for axis labels, panel titles, row labels, colourbar labels,
        and suptitle.  Default ``7``.
    tick_decimals
        Number of decimal digits shown on axis tick labels -- depth and
        easting/northing (metres) both use the same value.  ``None``
        (default) keeps the previous formatting unchanged: ``:g``
        auto-precision for depth, plain Matplotlib auto-ticks for
        easting/northing.
    show
        If True, also display the joint figure interactively via
        ``plt.show()`` -- in addition to saving, when ``plot_file`` is
        also given. Default False (save-only, matching prior behaviour).
    out
        Print progress messages.

    Notes
    -----
    The ``"std"`` row is rendered on a separate sequential colormap (``cividis``)
    anchored at zero -- because standard deviation is always non-negative and
    has a different physical meaning from resistivity.  Mean and median rows
    share the main colormap / clim.

    """Bar chart of per-member normalised RMS (nRMS) misfit for QC.

    One bar per ensemble member, coloured by convergence status. Intended
    for ``femtic.cnv`` -derived nRMS values collected while scanning an
    ensemble directory tree (see femtic_ens_post.py), so it accepts
    members with a missing/unusable nRMS (``nrms[i] is None`` or NaN --
    e.g. no ``femtic.cnv`` found, or no matching model file) alongside
    normally converged and over-threshold members, rather than requiring
    the caller to filter first.

    Parameters
    ----------
    labels
        One label per member (e.g. ensemble sub-directory name).
    nrms
        One nRMS value per member, same length as ``labels``. Use
        ``None`` (or ``float('nan')``) for members with no usable value.
    status
        Optional explicit status string per member, e.g. "accepted",
        "rejected_nrms", "missing_cnv", "missing_model". When omitted,
        status is inferred from ``nrms`` and ``threshold``: NaN ->
        "missing"; else "rejected_nrms" if ``threshold`` is set and
        ``nrms > threshold``, otherwise "accepted". Any status string not
        recognised by ``status_style`` falls back to a neutral grey.
    threshold
        Draw a dashed reference line at this nRMS value (e.g. the
        ``NRMS_MAX`` acceptance cutoff) and use it for status inference
        when ``status`` is not supplied. ``None`` omits the line.
    threshold_label
        Text placed next to the threshold line. Defaults to
        ``f"threshold = {threshold:g}"`` when ``threshold`` is set.
    sort_by
        "nrms" -- ascending nRMS (missing values sort last, as worst).
        "index" -- original ``labels``/``nrms`` order (scan order).
    horizontal
        True (default) -- horizontal bars, one row per member; reads
        better for many members / long directory-name labels. False --
        vertical bars.
    log_x
        Use a log-scaled value axis. Useful when a few members have a
        much larger nRMS than the rest and would otherwise compress the
        bulk of the bars into an unreadable sliver.
    status_style
        Optional override / extension of the default status ->
        ``dict(color=..., hatch=..., legend=...)`` mapping. Merged over
        the built-in defaults (accepted=steelblue, rejected_nrms=
        crimson/hatched, missing_cnv & missing_model=grey/hatched,
        missing=grey/hatched); keys not present in the default map are
        added, so custom status strings work without redefining
        everything.
    value_labels
        Annotate each bar with its nRMS value (or "n/a" for missing
        members) at the bar end.
    bar_height
        Bar thickness (data units along the category axis), 0-1.
    stub_frac
        Fraction of the value-axis range used as a zero-information
        placeholder bar length for missing members (which have no nRMS
        to size a real bar by), so they still read as a bar rather than
        vanishing at zero width.
    tick_fontsize, label_fontsize
        Axis tick / axis-label & title font sizes.
    figsize
        (width, height) in inches. Defaults to a size that scales with
        the number of members for horizontal layout (``(7, max(3,
        0.28 * n))``), or a fixed (10, 5) for vertical layout.
    dpi
        Raster DPI passed to ``savefig`` (vector formats ignore it).
    title
        Figure title. Defaults to an auto-generated summary, e.g.
        "Convergence: 42 accepted / 5 rejected (nRMS > 1.50) / 2 missing".
    plot_file
        Output path (with extension); ``None`` skips saving.
    show
        Call ``plt.show()`` after saving/building.
    out
        Print a one-line confirmation when ``plot_file`` is saved.

    Returns

    """Histogram of per-member nRMS misfit, binned over accepted members only.

    Companion to ``plot_convergence_bar`` (one bar *per member*): this
    function bins the nRMS values of ``binned_statuses`` members (default
    just ``"accepted"``) into ``bins`` equal-width intervals, so it stays
    readable for large ensembles where a per-member bar chart becomes a
    wall of rows. Members outside ``binned_statuses`` don't get numeric
    bins at all -- each such status is instead tallied into its own single
    aggregate bar appended after the last numeric bin: one "rejected" bar
    for ``"rejected_nrms"`` members (all lumped together, regardless of
    how far over threshold each one is), and one "missing" bar for members
    with no usable nRMS (``None``/NaN -- missing ``femtic.cnv``, missing
    model file), itself stacked by missing sub-status if more than one is
    present.

    Parameters
    ----------
    nrms
        One nRMS value per member. Use ``None`` (or NaN) for members with
        no usable value.
    status
        Optional explicit status string per member (same length as
        ``nrms``), e.g. "accepted", "rejected_nrms", "missing_cnv",
        "missing_model". When omitted, inferred from ``nrms`` and
        ``threshold`` the same way as ``plot_convergence_bar``: NaN ->
        "missing"; else "rejected_nrms" if ``threshold`` is set and
        ``nrms > threshold``, otherwise "accepted".
    threshold
        Draw a dashed reference line at this nRMS value (e.g. the
        ``NRMS_MAX`` acceptance cutoff) and use it for status inference
        when ``status`` is not supplied. ``None`` omits the line.
    threshold_label
        Text placed next to the threshold line. Defaults to
        ``f"threshold = {threshold:g}"`` when ``threshold`` is set.
    bins
        "auto" (default) -- ``n_bins_auto`` equal-width bins spanning the
        nRMS range of ``binned_statuses`` members only. int -- that many
        equal-width bins spanning the same range.
    n_bins_auto
        Number of bins used when ``bins="auto"``.
    status_style
        Optional override / extension of the default status -> ``dict(
        color=..., hatch=..., legend=...)`` mapping (same defaults as
        ``plot_convergence_bar``: accepted=steelblue, rejected_nrms=
        crimson/hatched, missing_cnv & missing_model & missing=
        grey/hatched).
    binned_statuses
        Which status(es) get real nRMS-axis bins; the bin range is taken
        from these members' nRMS values only. Default ``("accepted",)``
        -- only accepted members are binned, so widely-scattered rejected
        values can't stretch the axis and compress the accepted bulk into
        a sliver. Members with any other status get one aggregate bar
        each instead (see ``show_rejected_bar`` / ``show_missing_bar``).
    show_rejected_bar
        Append one bar (separated by a gap from the numeric bins)
        tallying all members with status "rejected_nrms" (only relevant
        when "rejected_nrms" is not itself in ``binned_statuses``).
    show_missing_bar
        Append one bar (separated by a gap) tallying all members with no
        usable nRMS, split by their own status (missing_cnv /
        missing_model / missing) if more than one such status is present.
    log_y
        Log-scale the count axis. Useful when one bin dominates and
        smaller bins would otherwise be unreadable.
    value_labels
        Print the total count on top of each bar.
    tick_fontsize, label_fontsize
        Axis tick / axis-label & title font sizes.
    figsize
        (width, height) in inches. Defaults to ``(8, 4.5)``.
    dpi
        Raster DPI passed to ``savefig`` (vector formats ignore it).
    title
        Figure title. Defaults to an auto-generated summary, matching
        ``plot_convergence_bar``'s default title.
    plot_file
        Output path (with extension); ``None`` skips saving.
    show
        Call ``plt.show()`` after saving/building.
    out
        Print a one-line confirmation when ``plot_file`` is saved.
